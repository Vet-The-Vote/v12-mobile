# Instructions to Install Debian 11

First you will need to create a bootable USB drive, which contains the Debian 11
installation media.  To do so first install [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/).  You
can [download Rufus here](https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/releases/download/v4.4/rufus-4.4p.exe), then double-click the file named `rufus-4.4.exe` to install Rufus.

Next, you will need to download the Debian 11 ISO file, which will be used by Rufus 
to create a bootable USB drive.  Click here to download the [Debian 11 ISO](https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/archive/11.8.0/amd64/iso-dvd/debian-11.8.0-amd64-DVD-1.iso) file.  Insert a USB drive into your computer.  Please note, 
the USB drive will be completely and permanently erased, so use one that is blank.  Then follow 
the steps oulined in this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvI0oyTsuxI&ab_channel=8BitSmits) to create a bootable Debian USB drive.  Please note the YouTube video demonstrates creating a bootable 
USB drive for Ubuntu, so you will want to select the file you downloaded a minute ago, which 
should have the filename `debian-11.8.0-amd64-DVD-1.iso`.

Then boot from the USB drive and install Debian 11 on your computer.  Please note, during the Debian 
installation take care to select the correct hard drive, because if you select the wrong one, 
**it will permanenlty wipe out all data on the hard drive**.
